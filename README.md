# 🧠 Outlier Detection using DBSCAN

This project demonstrates **unsupervised anomaly detection** using **DBSCAN**, a density-based clustering algorithm. It identifies outliers and clusters in a dataset without prior labels.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Detects noise points in numerical data using DBSCAN
- Automatically estimates clusters and outliers without pre-defining k (unlike KMeans)
- Visualizes clustering results using 2D/3D plots

---

## 📊 Key Concepts

- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**:
  - Groups closely packed points into clusters
  - Labels low-density points as outliers
- **Unsupervised learning**: No need for labeled data
- **Distance metrics & epsilon selection**: Important for DBSCAN performance

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
